A timed javascript coding quiz with multiple-choice questions that once taken, displays high scores of players and saves storage locally.

## Description

An application that an a student can use to study for a quiz on javascript material.

- My goal for this project was to design a javascript quiz where users may test their knowledge, log their highscores, and measure their ability to answer questions quickly.
- This task taught me a plethora of javascript material that I will be able to apply in my future challenges. I learned how to make a clickable quiz that generates questions and advances to the next page once they are answered. I learned how to save data locally on a browser so that phrases can be saved and retrieved later. I learned how to link several javascript, html, and CSS files together so that they work properly. I discovered how to program a timer that counts down and deducts points when users answer questions wrong. I am now more comfortable with learning further javascript and exploring languages related to it.
